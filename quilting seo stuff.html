It is easy to get confused when shopping for a quilting machine or sewing machine; so many brands, features, price ranges, and more. It can be hard to know where to start! So let's break down some of the things you may want to consider when looking for the best machine for you.

Brand:

There are a few main brands that you are going to see when you go browsing for a new machine: QNIQUE, Brother, Janome,  Singer,  White, Pfaff, Husqvarna Viking, Bernina, Babylock, and Juki. When considering brand, you want to think about how the machine is constructed and where the machine is made. Many brands no longer use parts made from metal, instead relying upon plastic, causing the machines to not last quite as long. In terms of where the machine is manufactured, consider whether having a product created in America important to you. If it is, then seek out a US manufacturer with "Made in America" on the box. My personal favorite brand for a mid-range price point is the Janome family of machines. I've taught on them for many years and they are consistent, well built, and easy to use for all sewing levels. I personally sew on older Husqvarna Viking and Bernina machines, but these are much higher in price and are only best when you are sure you are ready to jump into a serious machine.



Quilts are made either by hand or with a sewing machine. If you choose to quilt with a sewing machine, you will need a very durable machine in order to sew through all three layers and create a quilt that will last for years.
The following is a list of sewing machines that are up to the task.
