<p>Quilting started as a social activity. Farm wives got together when they weren&#39;t performing chores. They made bed coverings, curtains, petticoats and other articles. Patchwork was a result of a fabric shortage. Old items would be woven into a single fabric, producing wondrous designs. That form has become everything from an expression of art to a charitable statement.</p>
<p>Today quilting is as much a hobby for enjoyment as it is a professional endeavor. Whether for fun or profit, quilting is a great opportunity to create. Nothing has made these projects easier than the quilting sewing machine.</p>
<h2 itemprop="hasPart about">Types of Quilting</h2>
<p>Patchwork, or pieced, quilting is only one form of the art, usually the one most of us begin with. Most quilters tend to stay within traditional patterns that include blocks of rectangles and squares, rarely stepping outside of those shapes.</p>
<p>Fortunately, a quilting sewing machine leads to venturing into other styles, especially if one utilizes a more advanced model that allows for easy design. Postage stamp quilting consists of squaring, but small rows of objects. There is also the more difficult appliqué process that requires shapes on backgrounds that promise to create a stunning view. Paper piercing is developed when the quilter stitches fabric to a paper foundation. Used as guides, the quilter can block the entire quilt, constructing all sorts of objects and shapes.</p>
<h2 itemprop="hasPart about">The Growth and Beauty of Free Motion Quilting</h2>
<p>Free motion quilting has grown in popularity among quilters. This is an advanced stitch process where the sewing machine uses a darning foot as opposed to its feed dogs. This lets the fabric move freely with the quilter carefully feeding the fabric. This requires a steady hand as even an experienced quilter can easily disrupt the stitch process.</p>
<p>Free motion will produce an incredible design as it resembles embroidery done in a hand sewn fashion but with the convenience of modern technology. In the age of quilting sewing machines that can computer generate designs, old school quilters appreciate the greater control of the patterns free motion can put into their quilting.</p>
<p>Some quilting sewing machines make for a better range of free motion. There are also courses that can help the quilter develop the steady touch this process requires.</p>
<h2 itemprop="hasPart about">How to Select Quilting Sewing Machines</h2>
<p>From Singer to Brother, there are a broad selection of machines a quilter can choose from. A seasoned quilter will know how to wean through every feature, service and their accessories. Their experiences with quilting has taught them how to find the machine that fits. They look at the size, determining if it&#39;s too large or heavy for their considerations, especially if the quilting sewing machine has to go into the home. They look at everything in a machine, from built-in patterns, thread options and easy-to-use functionality. The professional quilter will consider customer needs and the production process to see if the quilting sewing machine can handle the workload.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are products that fit any budget and requirements.</p>
<p>With a dedication to sew and learn, and with the right quilting sewing machine, the quilter can look forward to a productive and enjoyable future with their passion.</p> ',

                'content' => '<p>The word quilt comes from the Latin word "culcita," which means stuffed sack. "Cuilte" is the French word that more closely resembles the term used in the English language. The earliest known quilt consisted of a garment that adorned an ivory figure of an Egyptian Pharaoh that was traced to 3,400 B.C. One of the earliest surviving bed quilts was found in Sicily and was created sometime during the 14th century. Measuring 106 inches by 122 inches, the historic piece can now be found in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. </p>

<h2>Hand Quilt Frames</h2>

<p>Pioneer women are credited with being the creators of hand quilt frames. The original frames might have stretched across the backs of chairs when in use. Other methods involved hanging the frame from the rafters of a home using ropes and pulleys. In each instance, when the day&#39;s work was completed, the quilt and frame were rolled or hoisted and removed from the living area. When homes and rooms grew larger, women could reserve a space to house the frame for extended lengths of time until the piece was completed. Full-sized, the Three Roller Frame and the Q-Snap Floor Frame are the three types of hand quilt frames commonly used today.</p>

<h2>Full-Sized Frame</h2>

<p>Also known as a stretcher frame, this device holds a stretched quilt horizontally, which creates a table-like image. The frame is typically constructed of wood and held together at the corners using C-clamps. Four legs support the frame and the quilt. The convenience of this type of frame involves the ability to hold the bottom, batting and top of the quilt tautly without the need for basting. </p>

<h2>Three-Roller Frame</h2>

<p>This type of frame is used for hand or machine quilting. The quilt back and batting are held in place by rolling the fabric onto two roller boards. The top of the quilt is rolled on a third board. All of the fabric layers are tightly maintained as the user rolls the quilt to the desired work section. Depending on the materials used in construction, the rollers may be extended or retracted to accommodate the length or width the quilt. </p>

<h2>Q-Snap Floor Frame</h2>

<p>This type of frame is typically constructed using PVC pipe. Similar to an embroidery hoop, the quilter lays the basted layers over the bottom frame and clamps the fabric using a top frame. Though having to baste a quilt prior to use, the lighter weight and smaller size of the overall frame makes the device easier to move from one location to another. Kits are also available that allow the user to tilt the frame to the angle of choice.</p>',

<p>For many years quilters had to go through the painstaking process of sewing their creations using a traditional sewing machine. This involved working in a tight space, trying to maneuver a large piece, or stack, of fabric. There is no question that the long arm sewing machine makes the joy of quilting even more joyous. If you are looking for affordable long arm quilting machines, there are a few very important questions to ask to ensure you end up with the best model. </p>

<strong>How much quilting space does the machine offer?</strong>
<p>The quilting space and throat space are not equal. Make sure to ask about available quilting space. When you consider investing into one of the affordable long arm quilting machines, remember the bigger is not always the best. The most fitting quilting space is always a comfortable distance for both reach and sight. The recommended distance, for the most comfortable controlled quilting, is from a 12-inch to a 14-inch reach.</p>

<strong>Does the machine run smoothly at both high and low speeds? How much does the machine weigh?</strong>
<p>A machine that is too heavy will cause stress on neck, arms, and back. Test any machine for five minutes or longer to get a sense of what several hours of quilting might feel like. A comfortable weight is usually 65 pounds or less. An excess of vibration can bring about intemperate noise and poor line quality.</p>

<strong>Where is the machine manufactured and is there a trusted warranty?</strong>
<p>If it is important to you that your quilting machine is produced in the United States, then ask the question. A trusted warranty for electrical, mechanical and the outer casting issues you a guarantee of grade A craftsmanship when investing in a quilting machine. Trustworthy companies will stand behind their product and provide a written warranty. They will also provide you convenient customer support services.</p>

<strong>Does the frame system require constant adjustment as you roll your quilt?</strong>
<p>Making acclamations to your knitting surface, by either bringing down or raising your quilt edge to give a level surface on which to join, every time you move your blanket, it turns out to be extremely badly designed and amazingly prolonged. An optional 24-inch Super Leader replaces the 18-inch leader and eliminates the need to reach across the frame to attach the backing.</p>

<p>By asking the right questions when shopping for affordable long arm quilting machines, you know you will get the features that you need in the end. Keep this handy guide with you as you shop, and always ask about any sewing machine feature you are unsure about.</p>',

<p>Creating a quilt can be one of the most beautiful crafting activities, but it can also be one of the most tedious. When looking at quilts that were made entirely by hand generations ago, it&#39;s hard to imagine how much time and effort it took. Fortunately, technology has advanced to the point of creating equipment that makes doing even the biggest and most complex quilt easier than ever.  For many quilters, a mid-arm machine such as the Qnique Quilter works best for their projects.  Allowing for work on projects that earlier would have required a long-arm machine, these machines offer a variety of features that make sewing even the most complex quilt a pleasure.</p>

<h2>Advantages of a Mid Arm Quilting Machine</h2>
<p>For those quilters who want plenty of work space packed into a smaller machine, the Qnique Quilter does just that.  A mid arm quilting machine offers numerous advantages over traditional long arm machines, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Extended Work Area</li>
<li>Multiple Accessory Ports</li>
<li>Dual Thread Towers</li>
<li>Built-in Stitch Regulation</li></ul>

<p>In addition, a mid arm quilting machine is easier to control due to its quick-access buttons that allow for all functions of the machine to be controlled from its two handles, each of which contain three function buttons.</p>

<h2>The Technology of Quilting</h2>
<p>What make today&#39;s quilts so much easier to make are the advances in technology.  With computer automated software such as Quiltmotion available on these machines, the possibilities are endless when it comes to the patterns and styles that can be used on modern quilts.  Whether working on a standard block or one that&#39;s a little bigger, a mid arm quilting machine can do the job every time.</p>

<h2>Mid Arms and Quilting Frames</h2>
<p>For many quilters, one of their biggest problems is finding a machine that fits well with their quilting frame.  With a mid arm machine such as the Qnique Quilter, this is never an issue.  The Grace Company, which is considered the pioneer of quilting frames, offers two frames that work well with mid arm machines.  The SR-2 sets up in Queen or Crib size, while the recently-developed Qnique 14+ frame is a king-size version designed specifically for larger quilts.</p>

<p>Making the best quilt takes the right combination of skill, style and patience along with the best equipment.  For beginners as well as experienced quilters, using a mid arm quilting machine such as the Qnique Quilter can help turn an ordinary quilt into a true masterpiece.</p>',
